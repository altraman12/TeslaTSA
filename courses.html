                                Engineer Your World is a one-year high school engineering curriculum developed by the Cockrell
School of Engineering at University of Texas at Austin in collaboration with the National Science
Foundation and NASA. This hands-on, project-based course emphasizes the historic achievements and
contemporary challenges of engineers, the engineering design process, and the skills and habits of mind
that engineers find most essential in their work. Our first unit focuses on establishing norms for all of
our group interactions and for effective documentation of our projects in our engineering OneNote
notebooks. The next five units all involve designing, building, and testing devices or systems of devices
to accomplish specific tasks in response to customer needs. Each unit also emphasizes several specific
aspects of the work of professional engineers.

                                In a word, this course in interdisciplinary, involving the field of
ecology, biology, ocean and atmospheric sciences, climatology, chemistry, geology,
physics, toxicology, geography, economics, politics, and ethics, to name a few. Because
of this blend of subject matter, this course is often perceived as a class somewhat
different from what any students have encountered in their previous coursework. This
course is designed to be the equivalent of a college introductory environmental science
course, both in the range of topics studied, and in the depth, specificity and detail of
course material.

solutions are the central theme of this course. In EESD we will explore “green jobs” and
solutions to a number of environmental issues through design, efficiency and engineering
projects. Topics covered include LEED certification, green construction, alternative energy,
water and waste management, transportation system design, public land use, ecosystem services,
and urban design and community planning.

biodiversity. The curriculum is dictated by the College Board. This course meets the goals and
objectives of the College Board Advanced Placement Biology Program and is designed to prepare
students to take the AP Biology test in May.

chemistry. Therefore, it is a much faster pace than that which you may be accustomed. As in college, it is
assumed that you are entering this class with a fundamental knowledge of chemistry equivalent to that of a first
year high school chemistry course. We must stick to the schedule. We will not have time in class to pause or go
back to cover material with which you are having trouble.
