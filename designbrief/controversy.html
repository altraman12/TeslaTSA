                        With the rapid growth of AR products like the Microsoft Hololens and the Google Glass, the safety and economical concerns and issues must be looked into. Why has AR technology only just taken off? What obstacles does this budding technology face in a ruthless market? What ethical and safety risks does it pose society?

                    <p><b>Issue:</b> Excitement for AR technologies has grown exponentially in the past few years due to an array of innovative new AR products. Despite this, due to economic concerns a real market penetration of this technology is still many years away. While the Microsoft's “Hololens” has generated a huge interest into AR, its $3,000 price budget keeps it out of the hands of the average consumer. One area where AR technology is in it’s display technology. Creating a cheap yet vivid display, has been a difficult challenge for researches especially considering that unlike mobile or TV screens making transparent screens for AR is a relatively new field.  While technologies like Virtual Reality can make use of existing research done on the mobile front, Hololens will have to branch out in a whole new direction. In addition to actually display the increasingly complex images on these newer screens research into cheap lightweight graphics processors will have to keep up.

                    <p>
                         <b>Solution: </b> The easiest way to solve this issue is by putting more research dollars into developing more efficient systems. One area where this can be seen in is through Microsoft's custom HPU (Holographic processing unit). By making a process chip that is solely dedicated to handling the stress of  holographic projection, they are able to cut out a lot of the excess weight and cost associated with using an existing processing chip. While currently due the restriction in AR screen technologies most AR devices have opted to compensate by using smaller screens. This may improve in the future by technologies such as Magic Leap’s Dynamic Digitised Lightfield Signal, which cuts out the screen entirely by projecting images straight into your eye.

                    <p><b>Issue: </b> While AR devices are intended to improve the processing power of the user, the devices ironically end up having quite the opposite impact. One big safety risk associated with AR technologies is their use while driving. While at first it may seem like an non-issue as the user can easily see past the screen, focusing on both surfaces is the root of the problem. On top of a loss of mental focus, shifting your eye’s focus between close and far objects has a large enough delay to represent a large in increase in motor-vehicle accidents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of AR technology even outside of the vehicles in has many potential safety risks, due to the negative impact these lens have on the user's peripheral vision. While these screens may impede the center of the user’s vision, the periphery vision is a crucial indicator for speed and distance to nearby objects. As shown by the <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer/danacenter/publications/west_docs/divided_visual_attention_predictor_bumping_salisbury.pdf"> Salisbury Eye Evaluation</a>, users with distractions in their peripheral became much more likely to accidently bump into nearby objects misjudging their relative distance to these items.

                    <p><b>Solution: </b> One way that AR design is accounting for these safety risks is through the use of sensors on the AR devices. Disabling the AR device upon detecting car motion is an example of an easy fix to the motor vehicle problem (getting consumers to accept this is another issue). In addition AR training , similar to that undergone by fighter jet pilots who require HUD displays, could be mandatory for use of these gadgets. This would accustom users to the focus shift required to properly use these devices.
