                    <p>There are many risks associated with the use and implementation of drones in the modern world. The most obvious being an intrusion of privacy, as drones equipped with cameras can easily peek into households and urban areas. This intrusion
                        of private property has caused debate, and an example of a similar situation would be the lawsuits against Google for faces in their Google Earth and Streetview images. Another concern of drone usage is safety and security. Drones
                        face the risk of being hijacked and are easily equipped with dangerous weapons, and can easily become a threat to civilian life.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>To prevent these infringements and dangers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has required all drone users to register their drones with the government. The registration process costs $5 USD, and all drones over 0.5 pounds
                        must be registered. To register you must be at least 13 years of age, and a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident. Drones may be registered both by paper or online, however, they must be registered on paper if over 55 lbs.
                        or intended for use outside the US. A user identification number will then be given to you and this number must be physically marked onto each drone you own. Finally, the registration must be renewed every three years.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition, the FAA has posted general guidelines on drone use, and is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fly below 400 feet and remain clear of surrounding obstacles</li>
                        <li>Keep the aircraft within visual line of sight at all times</li>
                        <li>Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations</li>
                        <li>Do not fly within 5 miles of an airport unless you contact the airport and control tower before flying</li>
                        <li>Do not fly near people or stadiums</li>
                        <li>Do not fly an aircraft that weighs more than 55 pounds</li>
                        <li>Do not be careless or reckless with your unmanned aircraft; you could be fined for endangering people or other aircraft</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, of course the ethicality of UAVs remains disputed, so it is up for you to decide. Do drones represent an oppurtunity or a threat?</p>

                    <p><b>Issue:</b>With the ability to travel the skies rapidly, many issues of safety arise. Firstly we have the issue with the safety of the skies. In just the past year over 600 pilots have spotted unmanned drones while flying. While
                        drones may seem small and harmless, a drone weighing over 30 pounds hitting a aircraft travelling at 200+ mph would cause tremendous damage. This is a huge safety hazard that needs to be dealt with before air traffic gets even
                        worse By allowing drones in public places we open up risks of potential physical harm. Already drones have been shown capable of holding handguns and weapons. An anonymous flying killer could be a potential risk drones can cause.

                    <p>
                         <b>Solution: </b>Strict laws regulating the sale of drones and drone licences could be the solution. All drones and their owners would need to be identified and matched so in the case of a crime the perpetrator can be backtracked.
                        This is similar to the use of the drivers licence of a car to track a criminal. This is already taking place with the FAA already giving licences for some of the more professional drones, but stricter rules for acquiring a license
                        and harsher punishments for infringement may help stop safety hazards such as drone airspace infractions.

                    <p><b>Issue: </b>With the new freedoms of exploration issues of privacy arise. Privacy is a major concern around the world with many issues ranging from allowing the government to track our cars, to cracking San Bernardino terrorists'
                        iPhone. This issue extends to drones as well due to the unique places they can go. In the 16th century till the 19th century under "common law" any property you owned was yours "from the depths to the heavens ". This law allowed
                        you to own the sky above your land. The advent of airplanes resulted in a need for change, since airplanes couldn't be detoured to fly around every person's private property. This led to the United States v. Causby Supreme Court
                        case. This case established that you can only own the sky above your property that you could reasonably develop (often cited as being 83 feet). This case also created a public airspace 100-500 feet above your house depending on
                        where you live, where airplanes are exclusively allowed to roam. This law fit perfectly and worked until the modern day, where even these restrictions are not enough to prevent the issue of drones. Spying drones can easy fly on
                        the fringes of your property while streaming high definition video creating many potential privacy encroachments One big case, where this issue finally came to reality was in the case of William Meredith. This Kentucky man, after
                        spotting a drone flying over his backyard video taping his daughter sunbathing, shot it out of the sky. He was arrested for the destruction of property, but after many trials was let off. Despite this final outcome the question
                        still remained ... how are we going to retain privacy with drones able to fly over our yards?</p>

                    <!-- img src="assets/Images/commonlaw.jpg" class="img-dropshadow img-responsive img-margin"-->

                    <p><b>Solution: </b>One proposal by Legal Scholar Gregory McNeal proposed to extend property rights up to 350 feet. This simple solution seems like it may work at first to keep out drone snooping, but an issue still emerges. The problem
                        is that drones are only currently allowed to fly up to 400 feet. This is to create a 100 foot "buffer zone" to prevent any potential collisions between drones and commercial planes. By limiting ALL drones to 350 feet over residential
                        neighbourhoods drones are essentially given a 50 foot pocket where all drones, including commercial drones will have to fly. This could result in collision issues as the drone market slowly expands to a predicted 30,000 drones
                        by 2030 One of the major stakeholders in this issue Amazon had a different say on this issue. Amazon Vice President Gur Kimchi proposed turning all airplane airspace (under 500 feet) into a "Class G" airspace. This airspace would
                        be further divided into categories. 0-200 feet would be for hobbyists, 200-400 feet would be for commercial drones, and everything above that would be for airplanes. This paves the path for safe deliveries for Amazon, but doesn't
                        do anything to solve the privacy issue for hobbyists As you might imagine this issue is a difficult one due to the precarious balance that needs to be made between private property, hobbyists' airspace, commercial airspace, and
                        plane airspace. This balance must be struck to maintain privacy and collision free skies</p>
