                        <p>With the ability to travel the skies rapidly, many ways to make money can be extracted from the use of drones.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8">
                                <p>One of the biggest proponents for drone use in a commercial setting is Amazon. Constantly Amazon strives to reduce delivery times and prices to attract more customers to the on-line shopping realm rather than "Brick and
                                    Mortar" stores. Currently due to high wage costs for delivery men and scheduled routes, Amazon is limited in both time and cost. By using drones as a delivery medium Amazon hopes to launch a program called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011">Amazon Air</a>.
                                    In this program drones will be used to deliver packages to your doorstep within 30 minutes. This would also be cheap for Amazon since they would only have to invest one time into drones rather than paying high wages.
                                    This would reduce prices for customers, making this form of delivery a viable option in the future.</p>


                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Amazon faces many problems in developing this futuristic idea. Firstly weather is a big issue. Amazon cannot afford to be losing these drones to storms or gusts of wind, so the question remains how will the Amazon drones, which
                            currently operate like regular drones, deal with these conditions. Next security is a big deal with this type of use. Drones being shot out of the sky to rob packages is a very big issues these drones face, since these drones
                            are very fragile and will be impossible to monitor if shot. Finally a big problem Amazon air faces is figuring out the FAA regulations. If Amazon wants to progress with this scheme they will need to figure out a way to convince
                            the public that constant drone hovering over people's heads is worth the faster shipping. All these difficulties and the difficulty of developing and manufacturing the technology makes this plan still years away.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Another commercial use of drones is the use of drones to deliver internet access rather than satellite. More publicly, Google has been working on Project Loon to create global internet access using balloons , but Mark Zuckerburg's
                             <a href="https://info.internet.org/en/">Internet.org</a>hopes to achieve the same goal using drones. These drones would be much cheaper to deploy and use in vast areas of undeveloped land and would work by acting as flying
                            routers for people to connect to. This technology would help bring cheap internet access to millions in developing countries. These developments while seemingly philanthropic are also very commercial projects as well since
                            they would allow these companies to pull in millions of new users to their websites.

                                <p>Even in college education this technology will be immensely useful with drone technology substantially increasing potential exploration projects. Drones can help immensely in projects ranging from ecosystem rehabilitation
