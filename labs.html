and sustainability solutions, are the central themes of this course. In EESD, students explore green jobs
and solutions to a number of environmental issues through design, efficiency, and engineering projects.
Topics covered include LEED certification, green construction, alternative energy, water and waste
management, transportation system design, public land use, ecosystem services, and urban design and
community planning. This class includes instruction in specific tech skills, such as GIS/GPS, drafting,
energy auditing, 2D and 3D design, model building, landscape design, engineering testing, and
environmental impact statements. Student groups are encouraged to enter their projects in several
national and state contests. In addition, several of the Grand Challenges for Engineering are addressed,
including: Make Solar Energy Economical, Provide Energy from Fusion, Develop Carbon Sequestration
Methods, Manage the Nitrogen Cycle, Provide Access to Clean Water, and Engineer the Tool of Scientific
Discovery.</h2>

Language Arts and offers multiple opportunities for students to engage in systems biology problembased
learning. In addition to the systems approach to learning, students also tackle aspects of three of
the Grand Challenges in Engineering. For Reverse Engineering the Brain, students seek to understand
how the brain works and apply that knowledge to computing and problem-solving. In order to Advance
Health Informatics, students build databases and construct GPS/GIS crime maps to help predict crime
frequency in our geographical area and inform the public about their safety. The skills learned during
these activities will benefit students in other fields such as public health and homeland security as well.
Finally, with Engineering the Tools for Scientific Discovery, students grapple with new mathematical and
computing methods that are incorporated in this new emerging discipline of Systems Biology.</h2>

knowledge gained in Human Anatomy and Physiology and Biology to research and communicate medical
information to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. In Engineering Better Medicines,
students work to improve systems needed to offer safe and effective drugs to healthcare patients. As a
part of independent and group research in this stem lab concentration, students will be encouraged to
enter projects in state and national competitions. This lab combines Human Anatomy and Physiology
with Biomedical Engineering and English Language Arts.</h2>

investigation into the physical universe. It includes extensive mathematical modeling of physical
phenomena and calculus-based problem solving. Mind expanding theoretical material will be balanced
with hands-on lab investigations and projects. This class is designed to prepare students for future
science and engineering studies in college. It builds the analytical foundation for STEM fields in general
and for three specific Grand Challenges of Engineering; students use the laws of classical physics to
introduce the mechanical and electrical engineering basis to Maintain and Improve Urban Infrastructure,
the fundamentals of circuits and electronics to model and Reverse Engineer the Brain, and finally
students use their developing ability in both theory and practice to Engineer the Tools of Scientific
Discovery. </h2>
